This is a program I'm developing that integrates with my web server to populate a database with scanned barcodes that reflects what exists in my pantry.

In the end, this, combined with the recipe site, will allow me to keep track of what's in my pantry/fridge/freezer, as well as know what kind of food waste I incur and what recipes I'm able to make with food on hand.
